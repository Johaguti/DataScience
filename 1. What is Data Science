1. Based on the videos and the reading material, how would you define a data scientist and data science?

    DATA SCIENCE: The data science is the process of using data to understand things, to understand the world! It is the art of   
	              discovering ideas, trends. Its components have existed for many decades and now all they are all coming together:   
				  Computacional Capabilities, probability and statistics, linear algebra, programming and databases. Data science traslate 
				  data into stories, using the storytelling to generate knowledge.
				  
   DATA SCIENTIST: A data scientist is a person who has multiple skills, including a curious mind, creativity, ability to communicate 
                  findings, ask good questions, use appropriate tools, love to play with the data and visualize the data. It is a person 
				  who tells stories to communicate their findings and finds solutions to problems analyzing the data and has a great 
				  ability to present the results. The video referred to a person with technical skills in mathematics, statistics, 
				  engineering, programming, databases and subject matter expertise, is like finding a unicorn, so the important thing is 
				  that you have the skills mentioned above and form a multidisciplinary team that generates a great work in team.
	
	According to the reading material, a data scientist is someone who finds solutions to problems by analyzing data using appropriate 
	tools and then tells stories to communicate their findings to the relevant stakeholders. Data science is defined as what data 
	scientists do. Is the student's definition close to what is defined in the course material?
				  
2. As discussed in the videos and the reading material, data science can be applied to problems across different industries. 
   What industry are you passionate about and would like to pursue a data science career in? 
   
   I am passionate about applying data science in the digital social media space, how to make recommendation engines for effective
   in what they serve,  how they can be improved with better machine learning algorithms, as well as better classification of the data.
   I would like to apply it in banking and insurance, it has high potential and a large amount of data to capture, apply algorithms, 
   and analyze market behavior.

   of a data science project?
